# zero-cross-game
This is my first project, where I utilized JavaScript to build the core functionality, complemented by HTML and CSS for styling and design. It marks the beginning of my journey into game development and showcases my ability to integrate these technologies effectively.

**Technologies Used:**

1. HTML → Structure
